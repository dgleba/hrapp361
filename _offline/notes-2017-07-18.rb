add class to yes radio button

jquery handler

if click yes, hide text fields and they will not submit with the form. it will all be ok. they will be nil.
    
    if no, show the fields, make them required by jquery find parent or next or something.
        
        use class not id. class can have same name on many objects. id should be unique on the dom.
